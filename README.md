================

This app is a work in progress.  It's a medium for writing down your thoughts without resorting to lists,
which are constraining; it's cleaner and more lightweight than a mindmap. It can be viewed at www.appforthinking.com.
The interesting code is at /general/static_files/js/ and /walls/.
